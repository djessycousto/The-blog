## About This Project

This project marks a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. It's my first website to feature an authentication system, cookies for session management, a comment section, and a dashboard for user interaction. I poured a lot of effort into building these features, and though the "Like" button currently has a minor bug, I plan to fix it in the near future.

Special thanks to **ChatGPT** for being an invaluable guide throughout the development processâ€”helping me solve problems, learn new concepts, and stay motivated.

### What's Next?

While I'm proud of this project, my focus now shifts to developing **Blog 3.0**, a fully functional blogging platform built using React. With each project, I'm excited to push the boundaries of my skills and continue growing as a developer.
